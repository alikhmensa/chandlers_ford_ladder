    <p>
      Players may challenge up to 4 places above their own step. The
      <strong>time control</strong> for the games is 80 minutes plus 10 seconds
      per move for each player. The decision as to who plays white is made at
      the start of the game by one of the players choosing a black or white pawn
      from a closed hand. For the full Rules, see below.
    </p>
    <p>The latest Ladder positions are shown in the table below.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Tournament Rules <em>per</em> Rob Sims October 2023</h2>
    <ul class="rules-list">
      <li>Initial positions on the ladder are determined in order of grade.</li>
      <li>
        All games to be played on the clock, which will be set at 80 minutes
        each with 10-second increments per move.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may challenge anyone who is one, two, three, or four places above
        you on the Ladder.
      </li>
      <li>A challenge cannot be made more than 7 days ahead of a game.</li>
      <li>
        If the lower-ranked player wins, the lower-ranked player takes the
        higher-ranked player's position on the Ladder, and the higher-ranked
        player moves down one place.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the higher-ranked player wins, there is no change in the players'
        rankings.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the game ends in a draw, the lower-ranked player takes the position
        just below the higher-ranked player.
      </li>
      <li>
        At least one of the players must play a Ladder game against someone else
        before they can play each other again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Report all results of games to Rob Sims for submission to ECF for
        grading purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        The top three players on Tuesday, 3rd September 2024, will play off to
        decide the eventual winner.
